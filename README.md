# Tomato Disease Detection

![GitHub Profile](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/your-github-username?v=4)

This repository contains the code developed during my internship at the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) in the field of Data Science. The project focuses on detecting tomato diseases using image classification techniques.

## Introduction

Tomato diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This project aims to leverage machine learning and image processing techniques to detect various tomato diseases from images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the PlantVillage dataset, which includes images of healthy and diseased tomato leaves. The dataset is preprocessed and filtered to focus on specific classes of interest.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib



## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adityajhakumar/tomato-disease.git
```

2. Navigate to the `CODES` directory:
```bash
cd tomato-disease/CODES
```

3. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Results

The results of the model's performance will be displayed after running the main script. This includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, along with sample images of correctly and incorrectly classified tomato leaves.
